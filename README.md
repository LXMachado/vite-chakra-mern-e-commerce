# MERN E-Commerce App

This is a full-stack e-commerce application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with **Vite** for the front-end development environment and **Chakra UI** for the component styling. The application includes features such as product management (create, read, update, and delete), and is designed to be modular and scalable.

## Features

- **Front-End**: Built with React, using Vite for fast development and Chakra UI for responsive, accessible components.
- **Back-End**: REST API built with Express.js and MongoDB for data storage, connected using Mongoose.
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Supports full product management â€” add, update, delete, and fetch products.
- **Environment Variables**: The server is configured to use environment variables for configurations like the database URI and server port.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End**: 
  - Vite (Development environment)
  - React
  - Chakra UI (Component library)

- **Back-End**:
  - Express.js (Server)
  - MongoDB (Database)
  - Mongoose (ODM)
  
- **Other Tools**:
  - Nodemon (for development)
  - dotenv (for managing environment variables)
  - Git (Version control)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (at least version 12.x)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or a cloud-based instance like MongoDB Atlas)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LXMachado/vite-chakra-mern-e-commerce.git
cd vite-chakra-mern-e-commerce
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to both the backend and frontend folders and install the dependencies for both the server and client.

bash
Copy code
# Install server dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install client dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following variables:

makefile
Copy code
MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
Replace <Your MongoDB URI> with your MongoDB connection string.
4. Running the Application
To start both the front-end and back-end development servers:

bash
Copy code
# Start the backend server
cd backend
npm run dev

# Start the front-end server (in another terminal)
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
The front-end will be running at http://localhost:3000.
The back-end will be running at http://localhost:5000.
5. Build for Production
To build the front-end for production, run the following:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm run build
This will create a dist folder with the production build of your front-end.

6. Deployment
Ensure you have both the front-end and back-end hosted on platforms like Netlify/Vercel (for front-end) and Heroku or similar services (for back-end).

7. Git Usage
To push your code to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
API Endpoints
The back-end provides several API endpoints to manage the products:

GET /api/products: Fetch all products
POST /api/products: Create a new product
PUT /api/products/:id: Update an existing product
DELETE /api/products/:id: Delete a product
Example Request
Here is an example of creating a new product:

bash
Copy code
POST /api/products
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Sample Product",
  "price": 99.99,
  "image": "http://example.com/image.jpg"
}
Folder Structure
bash
Copy code
/backend
  /config      # Contains db.js for database connection
  /controllers # Product controller logic
  /models      # Mongoose models
  /routes      # API routes for products
  server.js    # Entry point for the back-end server

/frontend
  /src
    /components  # Reusable UI components
    /pages       # Front-end pages
  vite.config.js # Vite configuration
